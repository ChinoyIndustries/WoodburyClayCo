         <h1>Glossary of Forms and Terms</h1>
         <h2>Useful Terms</h2>
         <p>Not everyone who ends up on this website is a railroad enthusiast. Here's some of the
            railroad and shipping terms that you might encounter around here:</p>
         <table id="glossary">
            <tr>
               <td>
                  <ul>
                     <li><b><i>Home road/Foreign road</i></b>: A freight car traveling on the lines
                        of the railroad that owns it is said to be a "home road" car, while a car
                        from one railroad traveling over another road is a "foreign" car.</li>
                     <li><b><i>LCL</i></b>: Short for <i>"<b>L</b>ess than
                           <b>C</b>ar<b>l</b>oad"</i>. Small shipments of individual packages or
                        crates that don't fill an entire freight car often traveled in a car
                        together with many other such shipments heading the same direction, which would be
                        stopped at various points along the way to load, unload, or transload freight into
                        another car.</li>
                     <li><b><i>Transload</i></b>: To swap cargo from one car to another. This was
                        often done to empty out a foreign car and send it back home faster, or to rearrange
                        incoming LCL shipments at a major freight terminal to fill a new car of
                        freight all going the same direction. With the advent of containerized
                        freight and the decline of LCL shipping by rail since the 1960s, this
                        practice is long since obsolete, but was very commonplace before WWII. </li>
                  </ul>
               </td>
               <td>
                  <ul>
                     <li><b><i>Consignee</i></b>: The business or individual to whom a shipment is
                        consigned, i.e. who is receiving the shipment (and the bill for it, unless
                        prepaid by the shipper) at its destination&mdash;the "addressee" for
                        freight.</li>
                     <li><b><i>Lading</i></b>: Cargo or freight, i.e., what a freight car (or truck,
                        or ship) is "laden" with.</li>
                     <li><b><i>Railway Express Agency (REA)</i></b>: The REA was the dominant
                        nationwide delivery service for shipping express packages and parcels by
                        rail for much of the 20th c. Commonly remembered for its green express cars
                        that carried high-priority parcels and perishables at the front of passenger
                        trains, they also offered delivery services by truck from railroad freight
                        stations in many areas.</li>
                  </ul>
               </td>
               <td>
                  <ul>
                     <li><b><i>Track scale</i></b>: All shipments of bulk cargo (coal, iron ore,
                        clay and so on) are shipped by weight like packages at the post office, so
                        for accurate billing, every car must be weighed on a scale. Track scales,
                        which are built into the track and weigh cars as they pass over it, were
                        once a common feature of most major railroad yards. The nearest such
                        facility to Oreminea, where all outbound cars of clay had to be weighed, was
                        the enormous yard in Altoona, which contained several scales. Almost all
                        outbound shipments from the W.C.C. were weighed at the Juniata Scales, but a
                        handful passed through the East Altoona Scales elsewhere in the yard.</li>
                     <li><b><i>Weighmaster</i></b>: The operator of a track scale. A weighmaster's
                        job is to provide legally certified weights of all shipments that pass over
                        his scale. The job still exists today, usually for operators of truck scales
                        at scrapyards, grain elevators, pulp mills, cement plants, and other
                        businesses that send and receive large dump or hopper trucks.</li>
                  </ul>

         <h2>The C. T. and You: What Are All These Forms?</h2>
         <div class="textcontent">
            <p>As one of the largest, busiest and most profitable railroad systems in the world for
               decades, the Pennsylvania Railroad took to calling themselves the "Standard Railroad
               of the World". They were, in fact, incredibly good at keeping to
               standards&mdash;their own unique internal standards not shared with any other
               company. Virtually everything on the PRR&mdash;from locomotives, cars and station
               buildings down to tools, hardware and telegraph insulators&mdash;was either made by
               the PRR themselves, or custom built or ordered to the PRR's own exhaustively
               specified standards. Fittingly, the thousands of kinds of various paper forms and
               documents used throughout the PRR system were all standardized as well, with each and
               every one bearing a unique form number. Records explaining what each one signified
               and how they were assigned are scarce, but generally, "A.D." refers to the Accounting
               Department, "C.T." to the Transportation Department, and "F.D." to the Freight
               Department.</p>
            <p>Outbound carloads in the W.C.C. collection are recorded in C.T.1098 forms (no, not
               the 1098-T forms that we college students have to get to file our taxes!). These are
               "Reports of Carloads Weighed": receipts from the track scales in nearby Altoona,
               returned to the W.C.C. to keep record of all outbound shipments. Inbound shipments
               are represented by freight bills to the W.C.C., of various subtly different
               varieties, which generally record the shipper, destination, car, cargo, and shipping
               cost.</p>
            <p>For the use of the PRR historian, and for those who wish to reproduce authentic PRR
               paperwork for use in model railroad operating sessions, below is a list of form
               numbers which appear in this collection.</p>

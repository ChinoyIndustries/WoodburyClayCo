DH project, spring 2020--freight receipts of the Woodbury Clay Co., 1925-1937

Hello! This site was initially created by me (Connor Chinoy) as a class project for the Digital Humanities program at Pitt-Greensburg, spring semester 2020. However, it still has potential to continue developing further in the long term as an online historical resource, and updates may resume in the future (July '21 --CRC)

Here's what had been planned for future updates to the site when the project semester concluded. Hopefully you'll see some of these changes coming around soon!

- QGIS carload map
  - Hover over each point to see total no. of carloads sent there (make this field visible in tooltip)
  - Overlay the 1923 system map somehow
- Table of Carloads: sort by date, car, class, shipper, consignee (just use jquery)
- Bill pages
  - Move portrait-format images to the righthand side?
  - Show All Bills gallery page
- Company pages: include section of carloadtable for said company on each company page.
- Static top-level pages I still have to write:
  - Background page: Background of the clay industry, the Woodbury Clay Co., and the PRR in that region.
    - Include C.T.1000 scans: 1898 (130) and 1945 (162-164)
  - About this project page: About the documents, where I found them and how I digitized them, CT1000 lookups (link to whoever has digital CT1000&#39;s), include pics of documents and CT1000&#39;s on table

- Misc. to-do:
  - Finish drawing gifs for freight car class thumbnails
  - Shrink bill images so they load faster (imagemagick)
  - seek permissions for usage: gifs, 1923 map, PSU photos
  - add that and a picture from the PSU collection to Introduction page, just to break it up
  - finish explanation of graphs on Company Table
  - finish explanation of graphs on Car Class Table
  
- Future Development Ideas
  - Model This Industry
    - Available models of the various boxcars and other cars. Main car class index page is where you can use SVG: graph boxcar classes by percentage by year, this will hopefully show the decline of XL boxcars which were being phased out in these years, as well as the proportions in which the different classes should be represented on a layout
    - More in-depth information on the power shovel and the plymouth locomotive--this is where you want that Plymouth illustration to go. Email AIM for permission to use Plymouth catalog illustration

         <div class="textcontent">
            <p>So what is this place? The <b>Woodbury Clay Co. Project</b>, built as a one-man <a
                  href="about.html">(that's me!)</a> class project for the <a
                  href="https://newtfire.org/courses/dh/index.html" target="_blank">Digital
                  Humanities</a> program at the <a href="https://www.greensburg.pitt.edu/"
                  target="_blank">University of Pittsburgh&mdash;Greensburg</a>, is a website
               devoted to exploring the history of the clay mining industry in central Pennsylvania,
               as seen through an unusual historical snapshot. What we have here is a collection of
               118 pieces of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Railroad"
                  >Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR)</a> paperwork, dating mostly from 1931, '33 and '37, from the
               Woodbury Clay Co. (formerly the Woodbury Land Co.) of Oreminea&mdash;a former mining town
               5 miles down the valley from Williamsburg, in rural Blair Co., PA. These documents make
               for a rare and valuable resource for enthusiasts of railroad and industrial history,
               as they're all the sort of ephemera that rarely survives&mdash;tissue-paper freight
               bills and receipts from individual railroad shipments. In the era long before
               computerized systems, countless thousands of these forms were hurriedly typed up and
               forwarded every day to thousands of points across the Pennsylvania Railroad system to
               record and bill for every movement of freight. Upon proper payment, filing and so on,
               they were totally disposable. It remains a mystery why these were saved, and by whom,
               but they managed to survive the intervening 80+ years only to wind up scattered among
               an enormous heap of old railroad books and magazines on <a
                  href="http://www.duncansvilleantiquedepot.com/" target="_blank">a flea market
                  table in Hollidaysburg, PA,</a> where I discovered them in the spring of 2017.</p>
            <p>This site aims not only to present these historic documents to the public, but to
               explore the interactions of the clay-mining industry with the wide variety of
               businesses, industries and manufacturing concerns across the region who appear
               therein. The Woodbury Clay Co. papers record the journeys of <b>144</b> individual
               railroad cars to and from Oreminea, representing a total of 49 different suppliers
               and customers, plus two brokers of clay who shipped from the Woodbury Clay Co.
               Twenty-one different businesses are seen shipping supplies into Oreminea&mdash;not
               only machinery and mining supplies for the company, but also general goods, clothing
               and foodstuffs for the town's inhabitants, down to individual boxes of shoes! It's
               easy to forget nowadays, but before America was crisscrossed by highways, the
               railroad was often the only lifeline into rural communities and company towns like
               Oreminea, and truly <i>everything</i> arrived and left by rail.</p>
            <p>Outbound shipments from town, however, were all in the form of boxcars (well, mostly
               boxcars) loaded with pure, raw fire clay. So, let's back up: what's that? While the
               mountains of central PA are quiet now, much of the surrounding region was alive with
               industrial activity through the Depression and wartime years, not only with lumbering
               and coal mining but with a number of smaller industries, including the mining of
               "fire clay": a silica-rich mineral clay that can be baked into extremely
               temperature-resistant bricks, called "refractory brick", which are used to line kilns
               and blast furnaces. (A plant that manufactures these bricks is known simply as a
               "refractory".) The fire-clay mines of Blair and Huntington counties chiefly fed the
               refractory, porcelain and steel industries of Pittsburgh and the surrounding
               manufacturing region. Very little legacy survives of this industry today, making this
               collection all the more valuable as a record of local history as well. Shipments are
               recorded to a total of 28 different steel mills and manufacturing plants across the
               eastern US and Canada.</p>

            <p>So what do we have to offer here at the Woodbury Clay Co. project so far? All 115
               freight bills and receipts are now viewable and tabulated, and can be explored from
               the main <b><a href="carloadtable.html">Carload Table</a></b>. <i>(Astute readers
                  will notice the discrepancy between that number and the first one at the top of
                  the page&mdash;there's three pieces of paper that don't quite fit in with the
                  rest. They'll be here soon.)</i> A history of the Woodbury Clay Co. itself and the
               town of Oreminea is slated to be written over on <b><a href="woodbury.html">its own
                     page</a></b>. There's a long way to go in exploring and recording the other 51
               companies that appear here, almost all of which are defunct and many of which are
               very nearly lost to history, but whatever information we've got so far can be seen
               over on the <b><a href="companies.html">List of Shippers and Customers</a></b>. The
               centerpiece of the project, besides the core Carload Table, is the interactive <b><a
                     href="qgis/map.html#6/38.917/-81.650">Map</a></b>, where all those shippers and
               customers are plotted out, and you can get a sense of where all these freight cars
               traveled to and from!</p>
            <p>For the model railroading crowd, the chance to see the exact breakdown of rolling
               stock that served a specific industry in a specific place in a specific era is a rare
               treat for prototype modelers. Check out the <b><a href="freightcars.html"
                     >Freight Cars</a></b> page for rolling stock information by class. There should
               be a lot more statistical information here, pending access to some 1930s editions of
               the O.R.E.R. Since this whole website's been built from scratch during the
               Coronavirus Apocalypse Shutdown of 2020, I haven't been able to visit where those can
               be found, so stay tuned as we ride out the collapse of modern American society!
               Modeling information on the PRR fleet of the 1930s is in the works for later on down
               the road. Additionally, for the PRR diehards and ops-session model railroaders out
               there, a reference of the various PRR forms that appear in the collection is included
               up in the <b><a href="glossary.html">Glossary</a></b>.</p>

         <h2>Document Encoding and Website Design</h2>
         <div class="textcontent">
            <p>This website was built as a class project for the <a
                  href="https://dh.newtfire.org/CDVSyll.html">Coding &amp; Data Visualization</a>
               course in the Digital Humanities program at Pitt-Greensburg. The project was intended
               to provide a real, public-facing home for these documents, and to explore the
               historical data they represent. What started as a folder of scanned images became the
               core of a major undertaking to encode data from all 115 documents, research the
               historical companies represented within it, generate dynamic webpages from it,
               explore it with visualizations and analysis, and ultimately to provide it with
               historical context on an ongoing basis. The Woodbury Clay Co. Project has expanded
               beyond the scope of a semester project, and will be growing and developing further in
               the future with more historical content on the places and trains that it
               features.</p>
            <h3>Data Encoding and Site Backend</h3>
            <p>The structure of the data behind the site is the same as the site itself: three core
               documents driving everything else. Information from the actual bills is encoded in
               XML as the CarloadTable, containing bill information for all 115 bills and carload
               information for all 144 cars, with references out to the other two tables. The
               CompanyTable and CarClassTable were built off this to store data separately about
               each company and location, and each type of freight car, that appears in the
               sample.</p>
            <p>The CompanyTable, despite being smaller than the main CarloadTable, was far and away
               the most arduous part of the project to produce. Its primary purpose, besides storing
               names and descriptions of each company, is to provide location and railroad data,
               which doesn't come from the documents themselves. Obtaining accurate and verified
               location data and railroad connections for 52 mostly-defunct Depression-era
               businesses and industrial facilities required, ultimately, burning through nearly two
               weeks doing nothing but research. An agonizing process of cross-referencing numerous
               sources and combing through the entire internet for addresses and other crucial
               evidence was necessary to pin down a total of 50 pairs of coordinates&mdash;all but
               one of which were successfully found and are exact to the individual parcel of land.
               (The offending exception is the <a href="/companies/fruhlinger.html">Fruhlinger
                  Colliery</a>, which refused to give up its secrets after two days and will require
               a visit to the Blair County offices and an interrogation of some old tax maps.) The
               process for locating each company generally followed the following pattern:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Google the company, then search for the city or town name on the freight bill or
                  receipt on Google Maps.</li>
               <li>If the company was easy to find, like a recently-closed major steel mill, gather
                  sources about it and record its general location.</li>
               <li>Turn to <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank"
                     >OpenStreetMap</a>, which contains layers for both current and abandoned former
                  rail lines, and inspect elements to find the name of the railroad line or branch
                  that served that place.</li>
               <li>If the location is off PRR lines, Google for what railroad served that placename,
                  and record which companies operated the line when. Usually, more research on local
                  railroad operations was necessary to determine exact configurations of what
                  railroads connected how and where.</li>
               <li>If the location is on the PRR, find that placename in the index of each <a
                     href="glossary.html">C.T.1000</a> and record the page number, find the branch
                  name found on OpenStreetMap if applicable, and confirm nearby locations in
                  sequence for companies' sidings that are not listed in these years.</li>
               <li>Open the <a href="http://www.pennpilot.psu.edu/" target="_blank">Penn Pilot</a>
                  historic aerial viewer and view the location on the 1937-42 photo set, position
                  Google Maps and/or OpenStreetMap to match, and compare to pinpoint the exact
                  building in question.</li>
               <li>If the company is a business that was not rail-served, or was not findable by any
                  of these methods, the fun part begins. City directories and other records from
                  Ancestry.com and numerous other places, independent local history websites, <a
                     href="https://libraries.psu.edu/about/collections/sanborn-fire-insurance-maps"
                     target="_blank">Sanborn Fire Maps</a>, <a
                     href="https://www.nps.gov/hdp/habs/index.htm" target="_blank">HABS</a> records,
                  and random PDFs and Google Books of all stripes were consulted at length.</li>
               <li>Based on all of the above, pin location on Google Maps and record its
                  coordinates, along with sources and references about the company and the railroads
                  that served its location.</li>
               <li>Scream.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ironically, the Woodbury Clay Co. itself, and the <a
                  href="companies/thomas-sant.html">Thomas H. Sant &amp; Sons Co.</a> brokers which
               appear as the shipper on many outbound bills, were two of the most difficult to track
               down.</p>
            <p>The CarClassTable is rather simple and contains mostly sources and image references.
               Additional statistics on the PRR's full freight car fleet of the 1930s are planned to
               be incorporated into this project in the future, to put the freight car types
               described here into context, but research of this kind is on hold due to the ongoing
               plague. This information is contained in books called the <a
                  href="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000536067" target="_blank">"Official
                  Railway Equipment Register"</a>, issued monthly since 1886. These are often
               available online for years prior to 1925, being in public domain, but all subsequent
               years remain under copyright and can only be found in a handful of major museum and
               institutional libraries. A trip to one of these is planned for when the national
               shutdown ends.</p>
            <p> The core pages of the website&mdash;a basic master/detail structure with an index
               page for each of the three tables, containing links to detail pages for each freight
               bill/receipt, each company, and each class of freight car&mdash;are generated
               dynamically from the XML tables using a combination of XSLT and XQuery. XQuery was
               used to query across all three tables to append counts, calculations, ID refs, and
               other information to one another. The pages themselves are generated with XSL
               transformations, pulling data, descriptions, links and images from the XML. The <a
                  href="https://www.saxonica.com/html/documentation/xsl-elements/result-document.html"
                  target="_blank">xsl:result-document</a> function within an xsl:for-each was used
               to automatically generate entire directories of individual detail pages at once. With
               this structure driving the website, additional information for each company and type
               of freight car can be added right into the XML tables, and the site itself can be
               instantly regenerated by pushing a few buttons to run the applicable queries and
               transformations. (The site's fourth table, the Forms table on the Glossary page, is
               static.) The detail pages for the companies and freight cars remain, for the moment,
               very bare, containing only the minimum content and whatever was left over from the
               initial research process of finding location data&mdash;to actually research and
               write up all of these would be vastly beyond the scope of a web-design project.</p>
            <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
            <p>In our class we covered a number of different techniques for presenting our data in
               interesting and useful ways, so the project website naturally has to feature at least
               a few of them. With 50 distinct locations represented in the data, plotting them all
               out on a map was the obvious choice. My dearly-obtained geodata were run through
               xQuery to produce a TSV table, then through <a href="https://qgis.org/en/site/"
                  target="_blank">QGIS</a> to plot them over <a
                  href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank">OpenStreetMap</a>, and
               finally through the <a href="https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web" target="_blank"
                  >QGIS2Web</a> plugin to produce an embeddable interactive <a
                  href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a> map. The sizing of each
               map marker to the number of cars sent or received by that company, generated in QGIS
               with a data-driven override, is not supported by Leaflet. A workaround to reintroduce
               this feature manually is in the works for a later update.</p>
            <p>As fun as it was to add a map to the site, it's only one of many potential means of
               visualizing the data from this project, and so I had to return to my data tables for
               a second look at what else could be further explored. One of the most unfortunate
               aspects of the whole project comes into play here: aside from a few earlier freight
               bills, all the Woodbury Clay papers date only from 1931, '33 and '37. Nothing is
               present from any of the years in between, and so what remains is far from a complete
               set of data. What this means is that it'd be mostly meaningless to try to analyze
               patterns or changes in shipments, customers and so on over time&mdash;in fact, with
               such a limited sample out of probably hundreds more shipments each year, the data are
               scarcely enough to be fully representative of the different inbound shipments, and
               likely doesn't capture many other customers to which Woodbury may have shipped clay.
               Without meaningful information over time, and without interconnectedness between
               individual shipments (besides their common point of origin/destination), network
               graphs and SVG timelines were out the window. Surprisingly, though, the data actually
               did happen to capture one notable trend that occurred over the course of the three
               sampled years. Recording the class of car used for dozens upon dozens of identical
               shipments of clay ended up producing a representative sample of the different classes
               of boxcar that the PRR operated in the Depression years, revealing a major shift
               going on in the pre-WWII freight car fleet, as described over on the <a
                  href="freightcars.html">Freight Cars</a> page.</p>
            <p>An SVG chart seemed to be in order to illustrate this, and so that became the
               secondary data viz format for the project. To make the charts and graphs found on
               each of the three main tables a bit more interactive, I created them with <a
                  href="https://developers.google.com/chart" target="_blank">Google Charts</a>
               javascript templates, which generate SVG graphs and charts of all different kinds
               with various formatting options and mouseover tooltips. I ended up using a <a
                  href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/columnchart#stacked-column-charts"
                  target="_blank">stacked column chart</a> for the above-mentioned example, plus a
               set of <a
                  href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/histogram"
                  target="_blank">histograms</a> on the Shippers and Customers page, and a (slightly
               overgrown) <a
                  href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/sankey"
                  target="_blank">Sankey flow diagram</a> depicting the general breakdown of all 144
               carloads in the data sample on the main Carload Table. Data input for each of these
               was generated with xQuery containing some really ferociously long xPath queries,
               complete with a cheering celebration when the longest one ran successfully on the
               first try. With that done, the major components of the Woodbury Clay Co. Project are
               up and running, and it's time to turn my attention back to hunting for
               Fruhlinger.</p>
            <hr />
            <h3>Graphics</h3>
            <p>The site banner is edited from a sign made using the free PRR sign maker from <a
                  href="http://prr.railfan.net/makesign.html" target="_blank">prr.railfan.net</a>.
               The shape and font are meant to depict a standard Pennsylvania Railroad station sign.
               The site colors themselves are chosen deliberately: the dark red is an approximation
               of PRR standard freight car red, while the light tan color is the approximate color
               of the fire-clay mined by the W.C.C.</p>
            <p>The little GIF pictures on the freight car class pages are a variety of railroad
               pixel-art that was briefly popular in the late 90s and early 2000s, traditionally
               drawn by hand for use in side-scrolling train screensavers or with the HTML "marquee"
               tag. Those featured here are in the most common scale of 10cm = 1 pixel. More
               information, and a vast archive of pixel-art trains from around the world, may be
               found at <a href="http://pc2.pxtr.de/" target="_blank">pxtr.de</a>. Credit for the
               majority of the freight car GIFs on this site is to <a

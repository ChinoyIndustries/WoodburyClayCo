         <h2>Document Ditigization and Research</h2>
         <p>I maintain a small library of books, documents, ephemera and artifacts from the Pennsylvania Railroad and other railroads and industries around Pennsylvania, and so far, the Woodbury Clay Co. papers make up one of the most unusual items in the collection. Once I gathered them up and brought them home, etc. etc., describe the process of scanning and digitizing here. Then, describe the agonizing research process that was necessary to obtain all those coordinates that are plotted on the map.</p>
         <h2>Document Encoding and Website Design (for DH folks)</h2>
         <p>Oh no, you forgot to write down how you did all this! (I'll write down how I did this shortly.)</p>

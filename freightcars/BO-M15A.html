         <h1>B&amp;O M-15a Boxcar</h1>
         <h2>1 Car</h2>
         <p>The M-15, a steel-framed, double-sheathed 40' car, was by far the most numerous
                class of boxcar on the Baltimore & Ohio throughout the 1920s and 30s, with over
                11,000 cars among seven subclasses. The M-15a series, 193000-196505 comprised the
                largest individual group of cars, with 3,390 of them built in 1912. The original
                M-15 and M-15a were "door-and-a-half" automobile boxcars, so named because they had
                a second, smaller door next to the main door on each side, permitting a larger
                opening. The image below is of a Westerfield HO model of the M-15a.</p><img width="1000" class="billimg" src="..\images\classpages\BO-M15A-Westerfield.jpg" alt="BO M-15a Boxcar" title="BO M-15a Boxcar"></div>

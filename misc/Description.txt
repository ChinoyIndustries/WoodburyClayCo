PRR Oreminea, PA-Woodbury Clay Co. Papers, ca. 1925-37, C. R. Chinoy Collection

Contents:

This collection of documents consists of various paperwork from the Pennsylvania Railroad, detailing inbound and outbound freight shipments to and from the fire clay mines of Oreminea, PA in 1925, 1931, 1933 and 1937, plus a handful of others. The majority come from the Woodbury Clay Co., with most of the remainder originating from Thomas Sant & Sons Co. There are three main sections of this collection as follows; in each section, a summary is provided, in which is compiled the date, car, class, shipper, consignee, and lading of each carload, as applicable.

	- Outbound shipments: 71 images, 112 carloads.
Outbound shipments are recorded in Reports of Carloads Weighed, from the Juniata Scales in Altoona, PA, where cars originating at Oreminea were weighed before departing. The Woodbury Clay Co. and Thomas Sant & Sons Co. shipped boxcars of crude fire clay to various companies for the manufacture of refractory brick, used in kilns and blast furnaces. Consignees listed consist mainly of refractory companies, steel mills and fabricating companies, and manufacturers of ceramic products. Notably, Woodbury Clay Co. shipped consistently to various Harbison Walker Refractories facilities throughout the Central PA region, while Thos. Sant & Sons Co. seems to have had a contract with the Locke Insulator Co. of Baltimore, MD. There are two examples of Prepaid freight bills in a separate folder in this section--these are from outbound shipments of fire clay from Thos. Sant & Sons Co for export to Canada. Multiple copies were prepared of each, and two separate copies were found for one particular bill (1933-08-23). 

	- Inbound shipments: 44 images, 29 carloads.
Inbound shipments are recorded in various Freight Bills received and paid, some of which have receipts attached to them. These show various shipments of supplies into the Woodbury Clay Co. Most of these are LCL freight shipments of various goods in boxcars, including several foreign road cars. Three carloads of coal are shown, as well as two significant arrivals of machinery on flatcars. On 2/24/1925, the Woodbury Clay Co. received a 4-wheel narrow-gauge industrial switcher from the Fate-Root-Heath company (manufacturer of Plymouth locomotives since 1919), which was used to haul small dump cars of clay from the mine pit to the PRR siding where clay was loaded into boxcars. On 3/19/1937, they also received a new Lorain Type 40 Power Gas Shovel--this was the Woodbury Clay Co.'s replacement for steam shovels, and operated in the clay mines at Oreminea throughout the 1940s. Photos of both of these machines can be found among the "Oreminea (Pa.) Mining Photograph Collection" of the Special Collections Library, Pennsylvania State University, viewable online at <https://www.flickr.com/photos/pennstatespecial/sets/72157629132251744/>.

	- "Report of Cars Released under Demurrage Agreement" for May 1931: 2 images, 35 carloads.
This lists all empty cars received by the Woodbury Clay Co. for loading with clay in that month.

There are three miscellaneous documents in addition to the above section. Two other freight bills were found that do not fall into either category of inbound or outbound carloads: one bill completed as a supplemental bill to a previous one, notifying Thos. Sant & Sons Co of a diverted carload, and one bill for a shipment of company materials (no charge) on the PRR under USRA administration during WWI. Finally, an unrelated PRR memo is included (see below).

This collection contains a total of 120 images, describing 177 carloads sent from or received at Oreminea, PA.

Naming convention: in each section, images are listed by date (YYYY-MM-DD); where multiple dates are provided, the date given is date of shipment. Multiple pages attached as one document are sublettered A, B, C, etc.; multiple documents from the same date are numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.

These documents were found at Antique Depot in Duncansville, PA, throughout spring 2017, among a large heap of railroad paperwork, rulebooks, timetables, and magazines from an unknown estate cleanout. Likely, these were saved by an employee of the PRR in Oreminea, although for what reason is unknown. This is the entirety of related material found. It is unknown why the paperwork that survives here are mostly from 1931, 1933 and 1937, but not the intervening years. All of the associated companies are defunct.

While sorting and scanning these papers, an unrelated typewritten memo fell out of the stack. It dates to March 1956 and notes the appointment of a safety inspector at the Hollidaysburg Reclamation Plant. It must have gotten caught up in the rest of the papers as they were gathered up.

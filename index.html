            <p>Welcome to the Woodbury Clay Co. project, where we take a stack of random paperwork
               from 90 years ago and shuffle it over and over until it turns into a website!</p>
            <p>Whether you're Dr. B, one of my fellow Pitt Digital-Humanities students here to see
               what I've been working on, or one of my railfan friends who's decided to come take a
               look at what all the complaining has been about, head on over to the <b><a
                     href="introduction.html">Introduction</a></b> to learn more about what's
               here!</p>

                  115 bills and receipts in the collection are viewable! Static pages now exist and
                  all links should be functional.</li>
               <li><span class="whatsnewdate">4/16/20:</span> Company and class tables and
                  individual pages now show carload counts. List of PRR forms is now uploaded!</li>
               <li><span class="whatsnewdate">4/17/20:</span> An interactive map of shipments is now
                  live, and the introduction page finally says something besides "I swear I'll write
                  something here later". Woodbury Clay Co. page added.</li>
               <li><span class="whatsnewdate">4/18/20:</span> Some quick CSS updates before the

                  far.</li>
               <li><span class="whatsnewdate">4/28/20:</span> Finally made a banner graphic and some
                  favicons. More copy, descriptions and formatting fixes are up, as well as new
                  "train gif" thumbnails over on the <a href="freightcars.html">Freight Cars</a>

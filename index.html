         <h1>Welcome!</h1>
         <p>Welcome to the Woodbury Clay Co. project, where we take a stack of random paperwork from 90 years ago and shuffle it over and over until it turns into a website!</p>
         <img src="images/under-construction-90s.gif" alt="Under Construction" title="Under Construction">
         <p>Oh man, it still looks like the 90s in here. Check back as often as you like though, things are going up around here as fast as I can bolt 'em together! The priority is on still getting all the features built, so don't expect shiny graphics and polish just yet. I'm well aware of how bad my CSS is.</p>
         <p>Whether you're Dr. B, one of my fellow Pitt Digital-Humanities students here to see what I've been working on, or one of my railfan friends who's decided to come take a look at what all the complaining has been about, head on over to the <b><a href="introduction.html">Introduction</a></b> to learn more about what's here so far!</p>

         <h2><i>What's New</i></h2>
         <p>4/15/20: Full list of shipments now online: all 115 bills and receipts in the collection are viewable! Static pages now exist and all links should be functional.</p>
         <p>4/16/20: Company and class tables and individual pages now show carload counts. List of PRR forms is now uploaded!</p>
         <p>4/17/20: An interactive map of shipments is now live, and the introduction page finally says something besides "I swear I'll write something here later". Woodbury Clay Co. page added.</p>

         <p>Download an offline copy of the original Woodbury Clay Co. Collection <a href="PRR-Woodbury-Clay-Co-Papers.zip">here</a>.</p>
         <p>Well, maybe don't download that just yet. The more I build this site out of that initial collection of scan-images and plain-text descriptions and tabulations that I first published in 2018, the more errors I find in it. An updated version will arrive once the dust settles.</p>

                        Altoona before being cancelled and sent back to Oreminea. The bill provides
                        an advance (credit) to the Woodbury Clay Co.'s account, to offset the
                        initial charge from when the car was shipped out. This car was originally
                        bound for the <a href="/companies/taylor-smith-taylor.html">Taylor, Smith & Taylor
                        Co.</a> in Chester, WV. Unfortunately, its original waybill did not
                        survive alongside this one.</td>

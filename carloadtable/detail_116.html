Along with <a href="detail_115.html">Comly-Flanigan & Co.</a>, it was one of a number of wholesale grocery concerns owned or operated by Jesse H. Lippincott, one of the 19th-century 'robber barons' involved with the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, notorious for its role in causing the Johnstown Flood.</p> <p>"Yellow Label" is noted below the carton of matches on the bill, referring to the type of hazardous cargo labels commonly in use at this time. Yellow labels were used for freight that was inflammable, but not liable to explode. CITE THIS WITH SOMETHING</p></td>

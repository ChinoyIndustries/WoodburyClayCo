                        freight bill for the shipment of a new power mining shovel to the Woodbury
                        Clay Co. It shipped out of Lorain on the B&amp;O, through Akron, OH to
                        the lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. The bill specifies the weight of the load as
                        34300 lbs, "exact blocking wt. 800 lbs.;" this phrasing indicates the weight
                        of the wooden chocks, supports, and chains used to secure the power shovel
                        to the car. While a "40 ft car" was ordered, a 50' PRR F30 was
                        supplied.</p> <p>This Model 40 gas-powered mining shovel was not
                        the first to be operated in the mines of the Woodbury Clay Co. The era of
                        steam shovels was already over in Oreminea; this shovel appears to have
                        supplemented an earlier gas-powered model that was in need of repair. A

                  <td>An LCL shipment of lead-acid storage batteries, which would have required
                        "DANGEROUS" placards on the outside of the car. At the time, railroad
                        shipping regulations utilized colored labels for individual packages of
                        hazardous cargo, with a white label corresponding to acids/corrosive
                        liquids. This shipment was ordered from the Butler Bros. supply company but
                        did not originate at their plant, instead being shipped from a supplier
                        somewhere in Brooklyn and departing the city by carfloat. The exact meaning
                        of "501 Bdks Bklyn Ba Wav Tfr N.J." is unclear but most likely refers to the
                        shipment being received and forwarded via the freight transfer terminal in
                        nearby Waverly, N.J., which ceased operations shortly after WWII.</td>

                  <td>This form is a receipt for a Bill of Lading, as opposed to a Freight Bill:
                        i.e., a receipt of the shipment itself and not an invoice for the payment
                        thereof. Unfortunately, the car in which these supplies were shipped is not
                        specified on the bill, but one thing is for certainâ€”it would have been
                        placarded "EXPLOSIVES"! These were supplies for blasting within the mine pit
                        at Oreminea.</td>

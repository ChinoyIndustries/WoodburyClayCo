         <h3><i>East Liverpool, OH</i></h3>
         <p>A Thomas Sant &amp; Sons Co., with a very inconsistent middle initial, is
            listed as the shipper in a significant portion of the outbound shipments from
            Oreminea, yet no other clay pit, siding, or mining company appears to have been
            based in Oreminea besides the Woodbury Clay Co. So who is this mysterious
            figure? The Thomas &lt;b&gt;H.&lt;/b&gt; Sant &amp; Sons Co. was a clay
            brokerage firm based in East Liverpool, Ohio, operating from YEAR YEAR YEAR
            YEAR. While the Woodbury Clay Co. itself shipped largely to manufacturers of
            refractory brick, and steel mills where refractory products would be molded
            on-site, the activities of the Thomas H. Sant Co. introduced additional variety
            to our list of shippers. They marketed various grades of clay from mines across
            Pennsylvania, Ohio and elsewhere to manufacturers of pottery, insulators and
            other ceramic products, usually on a per-carload basis. Finish description
            later.</p>

         <h3><i>St. Louis, MO</i></h3>
         <h3>2 Shipments</h3>
         <p>Famous manufacturer of "Buster Brown" brand shoes etc etc etc describe
                        more here. Company operated numerous factories and warehouses throughout the
                        city of St. Louis and elsewhere in Missouri by the 1930s, and continues to
                        operate today as Caleres Inc. As the only records from this shipper are
                        Railway Express receipts, neither the cars nor their originating location
                        are specified, so the location given on the map is for the company's
                        original headquarters building in downtown St. Louis at 1600 Washington Ave.
                        The company first occupied this location in 1891, but after its headquarters
                        moved to nearby Clayton, MO in 1952, the building was eventually demolished,
                        and the address now points to a parking lot. A number of Brown Shoe factory
                        buildings do however remain throughout the region, renovated for various
                        other uses.</p>

         <h3><i>Ore Hill, PA</i></h3>
         <h3>2 Shipments</h3>
         <p>Peter S. Duncan of Hollidaysburg, PA, was an industrialist who operated
                        several iron and clay mines in Blair Co. for many years, including a clay
                        pit in nearby Ore Hill, PA. Although substantially smaller than that at
                        Oreminea, this mine was served by the PRR's Bloomfield Branch. A sample of
                        sand excavated from this mine was among the mineral displays exhibited by
                        the State of Pennsylvania at the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. Peter
                        S. Duncan passed away in May of 1937â€”hence why "Peter S. Duncan
                        Estate" is listed as the shipper on the one bill in this collection on which
                        his name appears, from October of the same year. It is unclear why a
                        shipment of clay left Oreminea under this name. One potential explanation
                        might be that the mines at Ore Hill, which would have been largely mined out
                        after several decades of operation, shut down after his death, with the
                        estate filling remaining orders by contracting shipments from other clay
                        pits.</p>

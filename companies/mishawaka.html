         <h3><i>Mishawaka, IN</i></h3>
         <p>Famed manufacturer of a bunch of stuff, located at 312 N. Hill Street,
                    Mishawaka, on the old Elkhart & Western Rwy. This line was merged into the
                    Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Rwy., which became a part of the New York
                    Central system and ultimately Conrail before being abandoned in year. Plant
                    closed in year and has been demolished. The site is slated for redevelopment.
                    The Elkhart & Western railroad name has been revived for a new company
                    serving a segment of the original road, but the line through the center of
                    Mishawaka remains out of service. </p>

         <h1>Dean Coal Co.</h1>
         <div class="textcontent">The Deal Coal Co. was short lived and I could barely find any coherent information
                on it. Lots to paste here later.</div>

         <h2>Fruhlinger Colliery No. 1</h2>
         <h3><i>Dean, PA</i></h3>
         <h3>2 Shipments</h3>
         <div class="textcontent">A short-lived coal mine which has largely evaded all attempts at research.
                        Likely somewhere in Dean Twp., Cambria Co. Map point refers only to this
                        township. Explain more here.</div>

         <h2>Unknown</h2>
         <h3><i>Coalport, PA</i></h3>
         <h3>1 Shipment</h3>
         <div class="textcontent">C&C branch, explain more here. Siding 6287, erroneously reported as
                        being in Dean, is in sequence for Coalport along this branch, but does not
                        appear in either 1898 or 1945. However, an abandoned structure is clearly
                        visible on satellite imagery along the tracks at almost exactly the milepost
                        that such a number would have been assigned to. A visit to the site and to a
                        local historical society will be necessary to confirm the identity of this
                        structure. Most likely, this coal tipple shut down during the Depression not
                        long after the years of interest for this project.</div>

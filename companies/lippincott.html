         <p>Lippincott &amp; Co. was a wholesale grocer based in Philadelphia, with a
            secondary location in Altoona. Along with &lt;a
            href="/404.html"&gt;Comly-Flanigan &amp; Co.&lt;/a&gt;, it was one
            of a number of wholesale grocery concerns owned or operated by Jesse H.
            Lippincott, one of the 19th-century 'robber barons' involved with the South
            Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, notorious for its role in causing the
            Johnstown Flood.</p>

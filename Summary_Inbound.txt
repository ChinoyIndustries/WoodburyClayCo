Note A:
Shipped on a B&O flatcar, this locomotive was a small Plymouth (Fate-Root-Heath) 4 wheel switcher in the 10 ton range, model unknown, for use on narrow gauge industrial trackage within the clay mines.
A photo of it in operation can be seen in the Special Collections Archive of the Penn State University Library, available online here: <https://www.flickr.com/photos/pennstatespecial/7026606741/in/album-72157629132251744/>

Note B:
This is the only non-PRR form found in this collection: a B&O Prepaid Freight Bill. It specifies the weight of the load as 34300 lbs, "exact blocking wt. 800 lbs.", "40 ft car ordered"--a Pennsy F30 was used to satisfy this requirement. This "Lorain Type 40 Power Gas Shovel" was the Woodbury Clay Co.'s replacement for steam shovels, and operated in the clay mines at Oreminea throughout the 1940s.
